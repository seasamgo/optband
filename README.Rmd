## README

This package approaches simultaneous confidence bands for survival functions purely from an optimization perspective: given a certain coverage level, obtain bands such that the area between is minimized. `optband` imports `LambertW` and `utils` and provides an approximate solution based off local time arguments for both the survival and cumulative-hazard functions.

## Installation

````{r, message = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("seasamgo/optband")
library(optband)
````

## Methods 

`opt.ci(survi, conf.level = 0.95, fun = 'surv', tl = NA, tu = NA, samples = 1)`

`opt.ci` takes a `survfit` object from the `survival` package with the desired $1-\alpha$ coverage level, function of interest (either `'surv'` for the survival function or `'cumhaz'` for the cumulative-hazard function), optional upper or lower bounds for data truncation, and the number of samples to consider (1 or 2). Defaults are $\alpha=0.05$, `fun = 'surv'`, `tl = NA`, `tu = NA`, `samples = 1`.

Other methods/functions are internal and include `cumhaz.var`, `func.sum`, `modify.surv.fun`, `psi`, `riemsum`, and `surv.range`. For more, please view their corresponding help file.

## Example

Obtain confidence band for bladder cancer data set inherent to the `survival` package:

````{r}
library(survival)

## 1-sample case
dat <- bladder[bladder$enum==1,]
S <- survival::survfit(Surv(stop, event) ~ 1, type = "kaplan-meier", data = dat)
opt.S <- optband::opt.ci(S)
````
